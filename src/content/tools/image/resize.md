# Resize Image

Welcome to the fastest and most secure image resizing tool on the internet. Whether you need to scale down a massive photo to save disk space, adjust an image's dimensions to fit a specific website layout, or blow up a graphic for printing, File Forge's Image Resizer delivers precision controls right in your browser.

## Why Resize Locally?

Most online image resizers force you to upload your files to their servers. This not only wastes your bandwidth and time but also exposes your personal photos to massive privacy and security risks.

File Forge completely rethinks this process by leveraging WebAssembly and modern browser technologies:

- **100% Privacy**: Your photos never leave your device. The resizing happens entirely in your local system's memory.
- **Lightning Fast**: Since there are no uploads or downloads, resizing is instantaneous. Watch the image scale on your canvas in real-time.
- **No Size Limits**: Forget about arbitrary 5MB or 10MB upload limits. You can drop massive, high-resolution RAW exports into the workspace and resize them without a hitch.
- **Offline Mode**: Once you load the page, you can disconnect from the internet and continue resizing files without any interruptions.

## Advanced Resizing Engine

Our image resizer is packed with professional-grade features designed to give you absolute control over your image dimensions.

### 1. Unified Scale Control

Use the master Scale slider to fluidly adjust the overall size of your image from 10% all the way up to 400%. Need a specific size instantly? Click one of our quick-access preset buttons (25%, 50%, 1x, 2x, 4x) to instantly snap your image to the desired scale.

### 2. Smart Constraints ("Do Not Enlarge")

Scaling up raster images (like JPEGs or PNGs) beyond their original dimensions can often lead to pixelation and loss of quality. We include a strict **"Do not enlarge if smaller"** safety constraint. When ticked, the engine will strictly prevent the image from being scaled beyond its original 1x dimensions—perfect for batch workflows where you only want to shrink oversized files.

### 3. Aspect Ratio Control

Want to stretch your image or adjust it to exact, non-proportional dimensions? You can easily toggle the Aspect Ratio Lock. When unlocked, you can independently adjust the width and height inputs to create the exact bounding box you need. When locked, changing the width will perfectly and mathematically sync the height to prevent any distortion.

### 4. GPU-Accelerated Canvas

As you drag the bounding box handles or adjust the inputs, our WebGL-powered canvas gives you a smooth, 60fps real-time preview of your resized image. What you see is exactly what will be exported.

## How to Resize an Image

1. **Import Your Image**: Drag and drop your JPG, PNG, WebP, or AVIF file directly into the workspace canvas.
2. **Open Resize Tools**: Look to the Properties Panel on the right and make sure the Resize tool is active.
3. **Adjust the Dimensions**:
   - Type exact pixel values into the **Width** or **Height** boxes.
   - Use the **Scale slider** for a visual adjustment.
   - Or, simply grab the blue handles on the canvas and drag to resize!
4. **Export Your File**: Once your image looks perfect, click the "Export" button. The export engine captures your image at its exact new physical pixel dimensions and allows you to save it in your preferred format.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does resizing an image reduce its file size?**
Yes! If you scale down the physical dimensions (width and height) of an image, the resulting file will contain fewer pixels and significantly reduce the total file size in megabytes. This is the best way to compress images for websites or email.

**Will scaling my image up make it blurry?**
Traditional raster images (JPG, PNG) consist of fixed pixels. If you scale an image up beyond 100% (1x), the browser has to stretch those pixels, which can introduce blur or pixelation. For the best quality, we recommend never scaling above 100%, which is why we offer the "Do not enlarge" safety toggle. (If you need to enlarge an image without losing quality, try our AI Image Upscaler tool!)

**Is my original file modified?**
No. File Forge uses non-destructive editing. Your original file remains untouched on your hard drive. When you click Export, we generate a brand new resized copy for you to download.

**Can I unlock the proportions?**
Absolutely. By clicking the chainlink icon between the Width and Height inputs, you can unlink the aspect ratio. This allows you to stretch or squish the image to fit exact dimensions, though doing so will distort the original picture.
